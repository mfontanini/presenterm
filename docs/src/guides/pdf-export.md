# PDF export

Presentations can be converted into PDF by using a [helper tool](https://github.com/mfontanini/presenterm-export). You 
can install it by running:

```shell
pip install presenterm-export
```

> **Note**: make sure that `presenterm-export` works by running `presenterm-export --version` before attempting to 
> generate a PDF file. If you get errors related to _weasyprint_, follow their [installation 
> instructions](https://doc.courtbouillon.org/weasyprint/stable/first_steps.html) to ensure you meet all of their 
> dependencies. This has otherwise caused issues in macOS.

The only external dependency you'll need is [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/). After you've installed both of these, 
simply run _presenterm_ with the `--export-pdf` parameter to generate the output PDF:

```shell
presenterm --export-pdf examples/demo.md
```

The output PDF will be placed in `examples/demo.pdf`. The size of each page will depend on the size of your terminal so 
make sure to adjust accordingly before running the command above.

> Note: if you're using a separate virtual env to install _presenterm-export_ just make sure you activate it before 
> running _presenterm_ with the `--export-pdf` parameter.

## How it works

The conversion into PDF format is pretty convoluted. If you'd like to learn more visit
