# Acknowledgements

This tool is heavily inspired by:

* [slides](https://github.com/maaslalani/slides/)
* [lookatme](https://github.com/d0c-s4vage/lookatme).
* [sli.dev](https://sli.dev/).

Support for code highlighting on many languages is thanks to [bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat), which contains a 
custom set of syntaxes that extend [syntect](https://github.com/trishume/syntect)'s default set of supported languages. 
Run `presenterm --acknowledgements` to get a full list of all the licenses for the binary files being pulled in.


### Also a warm thanks goes to these wonderful people âœ¨
