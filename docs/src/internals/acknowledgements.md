# Acknowledgements

This tool is heavily inspired by:

* [slides][slides_url]
* [lookatme][lookatme_url]
* [sli.dev][slide_dev_url]

Support for code highlighting on many languages is thanks to [bat][bat_url], which contains a 
custom set of syntaxes that extend [syntect][syntect_url]'s default set of supported languages. 
Run `presenterm --acknowledgements` to get a full list of all the licenses for the binary files being pulled in.


### Also a warm thanks goes to these wonderful people âœ¨
